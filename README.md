# python-nexus-utilities
Functions to assist with building example NeXus files from existing ones.

Tested with Python 3.5. You can install dependencies with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Do `python example_instruments/sans2d/SANS2D_example.py` to run example using a NeXus file and Mantid instrument definition from the SANS2D instrument. This outputs a new NeXus file in the proposed new format.
